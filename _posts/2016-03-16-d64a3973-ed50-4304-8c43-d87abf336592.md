# Hello World

My name is ... Ah, what does that matter! You're here so thank you! Forget the grammar and spelling, excuse the language and just read the ideas. There is no purpose to this no motive than for my enjoyment and just someplace to post my rants. 

## Some Background 

I wasn't born in the U.S but have lived here most of my life and travel often, so that gives me a different view of the world than most Americans. Yes, America is great, but there is also so many things we have to fix, but hopefully, we will implement policies to make it better. I digress so let me tell you a bit about what I do. Uhmm OK, that's complicated because there are things I do to get paid and things I do for fun. Most of the time they overlap and sadly sometimes they are nowhere near each other. I consider myself first a photographer, then a video editor, web developer, and lastly just a creative.
I will post my images, videos, and some things that I think are just fun to see. Enjoy!
